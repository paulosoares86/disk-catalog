Introduction
============

This project is a searchable Disk Catalog built with Express.js and Angular 2. The objective is to show how ElasticSearch can be used along with MongoDB to provide full-text search.

Installation
============

First install ElasticSearch. If you are using OSX you can do this using homebrew

```shell
  brew install elasticsearch
```

Next you will need to install MongoDB. In OSX you can do this using the command

```

The last dependencies you should install are Node.js and npm. You can

to install them on OSX. 

Please make sure NodeJS version is >= 4.2

Tests
-----

To run tests you should install mocha

```shell
  npm install â€“g mocha
```

and after that, with ElasticSearch and MongoDB running just execute

```shell
