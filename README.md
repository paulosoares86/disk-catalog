Introduction
============

This project is a searchable Disk Catalog built with Express.js and Angular 2. The objective is to show how ElasticSearch can be used along with MongoDB to provide full-text search.

Installation
============

First install ElasticSearch. If you are using OS X you can do this using homebrew

```shell
  $ brew install elasticsearch
```

I recomend this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-elasticsearch-on-ubuntu-14-04) if you are using Ubuntu 14.04.

Next you will need to install MongoDB. In OS X you can do this using the command

```shell
  $ brew install mongodb
```

You can follow this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mongodb-on-ubuntu-14-04) if you are using Ubuntu 14.04.


The next dependencies you should install are Node.js and npm. You can
follow the steps listed [here](https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/installing-node-js-on-osx-10-10-yosemite/)
to install them on OS X. If you are on Ubuntu 14.04 you can type on your terminal:

```
  $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -
  $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Either way, please make sure NodeJS version is >= 4.2.

If you will use the application in development mode only, you can skip to the next sessions. Otherwise you will need Nginx and HAProxy. To install HAProxy in Ubuntu 14.04 you can follow [this tutorial](https://serversforhackers.com/load-balancing-with-haproxy)

Finally install forever and start 100 instances running `start.sh` script in the root of the repository

```
  $ sudo npm install -g forever
  $ sh start.sh
```

Tests
-----

To run tests you should install mocha

```shell
  $ npm install â€“g mocha
```

and after that, with ElasticSearch and MongoDB running just execute

```shell
  $ mocha
```

Execution
============

Development Environment
-----------------------

To run the application on your local machine start the backend

```shell
  $ node app.js
```

and after this

```shell
  $ cd frontend
  $ npm start
```

Performance
===========

Development

- POST `/disks` (to create new disks) 200 reqs / sec
- GET `/` (list of 25 objects): 200 reqs/sec
