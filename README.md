Disk catalog
==================

This project is a Disk Catalog. The objective is to show how ElasticSearch can
be used with MongoDB in order to provide full-text search.

The chosen framework for the backend is Node.js and AngularJS 2 for the frontend.

Installation

First install ElasticSearch. If you are using OSX you can do this using homebrew

```shell
  brew install elasticsearch
```

Next you will need to install MongoDB. In OSX you can do this using the command

```

The last dependencies you should install are Node.js and npm. You can
follow the steps listed [here](https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/installing-node-js-on-osx-10-10-yosemite/)
to install them on OSX. Please choose a version >= 4.2

Tests
-----

To run tests you should install mocha

```shell
  npm install â€“g mocha@1.16.2
```

and after that, with ElasticSearch and MongoDB running just execute

```shell
